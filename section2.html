                Tourists can explore nearby <strong>beaches</strong>, ride the cable cars at Ba Na Hills, or walk along the Han River to enjoy the city’s lively atmosphere — especially in the evening when the bridges and skyline are illuminated.

                Visitors can enjoy cool mountain weather, gardens, and scenic views from the cable cars. Ba Na Hills offers a calm escape from the city and a glimpse into both Vietnam’s history and modern creativity.

                One of the modern symbols of Da Nang, the <strong>Dragon Bridge</strong> sits on the <em>Han River</em>, linking the Son Tra coastal area with the city center. Inspired by the <em>Ly Dynasty Dragon</em>, it represents strength and prosperity in Vietnamese culture.
            </p>
            <p>
                On <strong>Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings at 9:00 PM</strong>, the bridge comes to life with a short fire and water show lasting about fifteen minutes. During this time, it’s closed to vehicles, but pedestrians gather to watch the lively performance.

            <p>
                After the show, visitors continue exploring nearby attractions such as the <em>Son Tra Night Market</em>, <em>Love Bridge</em>, and the <em>Dragon Carp Statue</em>. Other bridges along the Han River remain open, offering alternative views of the lightshow.
