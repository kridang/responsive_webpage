            ### Ba Na Hills
            Located about 20 kilometers from Da Nang, Ba Na Hills is a well-known **mountain resort** that combines French-style architecture with modern attractions. Originally built by French colonists in 1910, it’s now famous for landmarks like the **Iconic Golden Bridge** (Pictured below), the *French Village*, and the *Linh Ung Pagoda*.

            ### Dragon Bridge
            One of the modern symbols of Da Nang, the *Dragon Bridge* sits on the *Han River*, linking the Son Tra coastal area with the city center. Inspired by the *Ly Dynasty Dragon*, it represents strength and prosperity in Vietnamese culture. On **Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings at 9:00 PM**, the bridge comes to life with a short fire and water show that lasts about **fifteen minutes**. During this time, the bridge is closed to vehicles, but pedestrians gather to watch the lively performance.

            After the show, many visitors, including locals and tourists, continue exploring nearby attractions such as the *Son Tra Night Market*, *Love Bridge*, and the *Dragon Carp Statue*. While the Dragon Bridge temporarily closes for the event, other bridges along the Han River, like the *Tran Thi Ly Bridge* and *Han River Bridge*, remain open, keeping traffic flowing and offering alternative views of the lightshow.
